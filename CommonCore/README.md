Welcome to my **Common Core** journey!

## 🛠️ The Projects

### 🧬 The Essentials
* **[Libft]([https://github.com/yourlink](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/tree/main/CommonCore/Libft))** | *The C Standard Library, but by me.* Recreating standard C functions to build a solid library used throughout the entire curriculum.
* **[Get_Next_Line]([https://github.com/yourlink](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/tree/main/CommonCore/Get_Next_Line))** | *Reading lines shouldn't be this hard.* Developing a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor, mastering static variables and buffer management.
* **[ft_printf](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/tree/main/CommonCore/Ft_printf)** | *Formatted output from scratch.* A custom implementation of the famous `printf` function, handling various flags and conversions.

### 💻 Algorithms & Logic

* **[Push_Swap](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/tree/main/CommonCore/Push_swap)** | *Sorting with two stacks and a headache.* An algorithmic challenge to sort data using a limited set of instructions, optimized for the lowest possible move count.
* **[So_Long](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/tree/main/CommonCore/So_long)** | *My first 2D game.* A small top-down game built with the MiniLibX, focusing on window management, sprites, and event handling.

### 🐚 Unix & Concurrency
* **[Minitalk](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/tree/main/CommonCore/Minitalk)** | *Client-Server communication via signals.* A small data exchange program using UNIX signals (SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2) to transmit strings between processes.
* **[Minishell](https://github.com/Illouminus/Minishell)** | *As beautiful as a shell, as difficult as a hell.* A massive team project to create our own bash-like command interpreter, including environment variables, pipes, and redirections.
* **[Philosophers](https://github.com/adrih/Ecole42/CommonCore/Philosophers)** | *Dining with threads and mutexes.* Solving the classic Dining Philosophers problem to learn about concurrency, shared memory, and avoiding deadlocks.

### 🌐 Network & Infrastructure
* **[Born2BeRoot](https://github.com/yourlink)** | *SysAdmin 101.* Setting up a secure Debian server on a Virtual Machine with strict password policies, sudo configurations, and LVM.
* **[NetPractice](https://github.com/adrih/Ecole42/CommonCore/)** | *Fixing the internet.* A series of networking puzzles to master IP addressing, subnet masks, and routing tables.
* **[Inception](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/CommonCore/Inception)** | *Dockerizing the world.* Setting up a complex infrastructure of multiple services (Nginx, WordPress, MariaDB) using Docker Compose and strictly custom Dockerfiles.

### 🧊 Object-Oriented Programming
* **[CPP Modules](https://github.com/adrih1/Ecole42/CommonCore/CPP)** | *Transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming.* A deep dive into C++ to learn classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.
