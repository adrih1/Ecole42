## 💡 Philosophy
At 42, there are no teachers. We learn through **Peer-Learning** and **Project-Based** challenges. Every project in this repository has been defended in front of other students.

The goal isn't just to write code that works, but to write code that is **efficient, secure, and follows strict coding standards.**
